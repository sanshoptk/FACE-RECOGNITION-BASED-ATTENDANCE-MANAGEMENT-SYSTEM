# Face Recognition Based Attendance Management System

A computer vision–based attendance management system that uses facial recognition
to automatically identify individuals and record attendance in real time,
eliminating manual entry and reducing errors.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages **face recognition and image processing techniques** to
detect and recognize faces from images or live video streams. Once a face is
identified, the system automatically marks attendance and stores it in a
structured format for further analysis.
